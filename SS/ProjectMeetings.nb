f(e1) f(e2)==f(e3) f(e4)
the whole point of the h principle is that the probability of a collision is \
a factorable thing, making the particles positions independent.
Longtime tails studied thirty years.  When you have real particles \
interacting like this,  Hard sphere gases have these.
Nuclear weapons, radiation from clouds don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have these, \
their tails really matter.
Not exponential, it has a powerlaw piece.

The case where you start seeing thermodynamic behavior is in reversible CA \
where you can guarantee that any forward evolution can be inverted.  If you \
look at correlation function....
... reason that the atmosphere in Jupiter that instead of breaking into \
smaller pieces, you get blobs...
the question is what happens to this exponential correlation, cell that if a \
cell is black the probability it is black after t steps, averaged over all \
initial conditions.  In reversible CA you never get rid of the information \
that there was a black cell.  Is there an exponential fall off?

Entropy of the mapping.  How much do you need to know to find out inside?  \
Notes chapter 6. 960
How quickly is local information lost?

The other thing you could look at, given two black cells separated in space, \
what are the chances they are correlated in the future.

Related to the derivation of 2nd law.  If you can factor the distributions, \
if no correlation before they collide then entropy increases.  Molecular \
chaos assumption, tricky because they are correlated after a collision.  Try \
a finite size region too.  Some pattern, how quickly does it randomize.  Do \
it for a bunch of rules, there may be some intermediate cases where it does \
something really wild.\

Lucas 11:35  CA long distance connection configuration space
In general cycle lengths will tend to increase.
For subcases one can do math like shift CA

Gianpiero Cea 11:44
If you have a substitution system which determines which rule you use as you \
go down what will the pattern will be.
For one of these nested patterns what will happen as they interact.
You will find certain behaviors.  What kinds of behaviors occur, 3-4 seem \
like them all, then you can do a search after you have classified them.    \
Color rows of the CA according to the rule applied, maybe, or show the two in \
a row.

Polyominos.  In the case where you cannot tile, what is the closest packing \
you can get? p.218  Has it been proved that if they tile then they tile \
periodically.  (Not true)  If it does not tile, What is the configuration \
that has the smallest fraction of empty space?  First enumerate polynomios.  \
Then write code that arranges it in all possible ways.
What is the most for polynomio of fixed size


John DeBrota 12:21 - universal synthesis.  Figuring out what it takes to get \
what, string substitution.  Real chemistry that question is complicated.  \
What rules are universal constructors, that allow you to make any string.  \
Nanotechnology goal is the universal constructor.  A sequence of lights to a \
molecule.  This would be a junior version of that problem.  For what \
sequence, a more realistic case.  One could say it is always sequential \
substitution that always goes in the first place.  Under what circumstances, \
given a set of rules, given an initial string.  Start off by enumerating \
possible rules

Kiyoshi Okada 12:33 --  Size of proof survey, size of intermediate strings. \
p.776  The shortest proof can be quite long and can go through complicated \
stuff.  Go through all the simple rules, as axioms, for the simplest ones \
examine their proofs.  If true there is a proof length, no proof may be \
found, maybe very long who knows.

Medicine has Disease + code for diseases.  In computers things go wrong.  Is \
there a way to diagnose the diseases of the kernel [and give these diseases \
codes]  Imagine some binary with a bunch of bits.  Human goes to the ER check \
blood pressure + reflexes.  What do you look at in a running program?  Need \
database of crash dumps.  What does a dashboard look like in a running \
program?  What if you could do something with the binary stuff, not the \
symbol table.  Make NKS visualizations of a small C program in process.  A \
running nontrivial, its time evolution of the memory.  Maybe gnu utility like \
ls, gzip.

Nikolay Shenkov 5:23 Can you invent a system instead of 0s and 1s on a line?  \
It depends on fold.  Fold only if possible.  Enumerate possible rules.  \
Global constraint.  Mobile automaton with folding point. A CA in parallel \
probably always gets blocked.

Look at whole system.  Fold where there is least curvature or something.  \
Could just fold at 90 deg to see what happens. 

MA - sometimes rejects a move because it overlaps.  Folds and moves active \
cell, part of the rule says how to fold.  Color->{new color, fold, active \
cell movement}  Possibly 3D if constraint too much.

Miguel 8:10.  Fit description of finance data.  Compare what happens with a \
pure log normal plus volatility parameter versus these actual distributions, \
e.g. stock price data.  Find the empirical distribution.  Actual value lies \
within the prediction.  You will make a bunch of predictions.  Probably p is \
the predicted probability.  Good if it lies in the peak, sometimes it has to \
go wrong.  Predict empirical distribution does better than log normal by 20%

to what extent does that affect the downstream behavior.  If you have a model \
with bits of cracks, you can make a model.  What are the sizes of the \

Percolation theory was done before, fill in spaces on a lattice, at a certain \

is start with this lattice.  Some cells would be rock, fixed.  Model \
distribution of points.  Oil arrow and a water arrow.  Might be better on a \

points are free, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have grains.  Put down arrows for \
fluid.  Two-fluid rule and a rule for fluid interactions (repel)  How much \
oil gets trapped?  How does it move through the system?  More important to \
visualize what is happening.  I wonder whether you can derive Darcy\

Design problem. A facade surrounded by buildings.  Nearby buildings\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] shadow.  First step find a visualization that is more \
interesting than the average.  Different times of year.  Is it something \
like...  Divide the facade into different regions.  Start with highest area \
of sun another starts at low.  What is the impression of shadows at different \
times?  Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s image a whole bunch of little images showing \
configurations of shading.  First approximation angle of sun.  Different \
times of year.  Arrange pictures so that the set of impressions is a line \
through the grid of shadow configurations.  If change design ....  Could do \
something for average over all configurations that can occur.  Could be \
dynamic or not.

Say you now a distribution of light levels.  Arrange so that the levels are \
through the windows independent of shade.  Want to get something like a CA \
with a specified distribution of densities.  A 2D rule what happens, 2 \
possible rules, density p1 and p2.  Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s say you have a \
different rule in different regions.  What you are trying to avoid is p.578.  \
Use the same idea across the building.  Like the dither patterns 1078.  Put \
down a black square, scanning left to right, some diffusion.  There should be \
a CA.   Ideally should be a local decision, a sensor using a local rule, a \
shadow waves.
